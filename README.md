# my-cli-website

My "terminal/console" style personal website. Interact with the site while learning more about me by entering commands into the terminal UI. The website is built with HTML/CSS and Javascript using [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

Although I'm currenlty self-hosting an instance of this project with my home lab, I'm also hosting on github pages.
