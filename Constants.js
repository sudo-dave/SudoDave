const ABOUT =
  "\n\tAs far as I can remember, I've always tinkered with technology. When I was a kid I used to get in trouble dismantelling our home electronics." +
  " I just had to know how that tv remote worked. After high school, I took an intro to programming class at a local community college; since then I have been hooked." +
  " I'd always enjoyed tinkering with electronics but coding was different. I fell in love with the freedom and instant nature of it.\n" +
  "\n\tAfter two years, I was able to transfer to a University. There I started learning more about web-dev and cybersecuity. So much so, I started joining tech-related clubs at the school and sought other resources online." +
  " I taught my self frontend dev with Udemy courses and youtube. Eventually, my love of electronics colided with coding. Now I've been tinkering with rasberry pies and created a homelab out of one. So far it's been a blast." +
  "\n\n-- Thanks for learning a little more about me =)";
